Topic - Door Sensor.

Brief Description - In this project 'Door Sensor', I tried to design a simulation on simulide. In this model main highlight is atmega328 sensor, in this model we attached a led which will get connect to the particular Door. If the door is open it will start blinking and if closed it be off. The main purpose behind this project is the safety issue. It will help to know the person in seconds wheather his/her main door is open or locked without going there.
